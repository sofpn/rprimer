Title: Design Degenerate Oligos from a Multiple DNA Sequence Alignment
Version: 1.8.0
Description: 
    Functions, workflow and a Shiny application for visualizing sequence 
    conservation and designing degenerate primers, probes, and (RT)-(q/d)PCR 
    assays from a multiple DNA sequence alignment. The results can be presented 
    in data frame format and visualized as dashboard-like plots. For more information, 
    please see the package vignette.
